# `nvim` Treesitter

## Customizing Colors

- `TSPlaygroundToggle`: Use the `treesitter-playground` (with the plugin installed) in order to get the Treesitter syntax groups
- `TSCaptureUnderCursor`: Show the groups at cursor

## Troubleshooting

- Don't run `TSInstall all`, that installs all parsers
