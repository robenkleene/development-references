# iTerm

## Settings

- Turn on `Edit > Selection Respects Soft Boundaries` this is necessary to get iTerm to work well with tmux panes

## Sync

- iTerm supports storing settings in Dropbox, but it doesn't actually support syncing. The only solution is to quit iTerm, then overwrite the settings file with the correct settings, then re-open iTerm.

## Minimal Menu Bar

- Set `Preferences > Appearance > General > Theme > Minimal`
- The title can be hidden by toggling on `Custom window title` and setting it to empty, but it's useful to show to tell when an SSH session is active.
