# Visual Studio Code Explorer

- `⌘↓`: Open current file
- `⌃⌥⌘N`: Create a new file, this does not require the file browser to be focused
- `↩`: Rename selected file
- `⌘⌫`: Delete current file
- `⌥⇧⌘`, `right-click Copy Relative Path`: Copy path to file relative to the current file
- `>File: Reveal Active File in Explorer View`: This only works if the file is in the current workspace
- `⌥⌘R`: Reveal in Finder (this only works with the file explorer active, if the editor is active, then it toggles regular expression search)
