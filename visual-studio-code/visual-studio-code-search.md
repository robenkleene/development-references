# Visual Studio Code Search

- `⌘↩`: Open Search Editor
- `⇧F4` / `F4`: Previous / next search result
- `⌘↓`: From the search field, focus search results
- `⌘K M`: Change language mode
- `⌥⌘R`: Toggle regular expressions
- `⇧⌘E`: Clear search results by switching to the explorer
- `⇧⌘F`: Toggle search details (e.g., `Files to include`)

## Search Editor

- `⌥-` / `⌥+`: Decrease / increase the amount of context.

## Multiple Cursors

- `⌥↩`: Enter multiple cursors for each search match (if this isn't working, it's usually because the search isn't setup correctly, it's a good practice to use `⌥E` then `⌥G` to check that it iterates through the expected matches).

To limit the matches just to the current selection, toggle on "Find in selection" (`⌥⌘L`).
