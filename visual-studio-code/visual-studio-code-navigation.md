# Visual Studio Code Navigation

- `⌘T`: Go to symbol in project
- `⌘⇧O`: Go to symbol in file
- `⌘-click`: Open link
- `⌃⇥`: See previous files
- `⌘K ↩`: Take file out of preview mode, so choosing another file doesn't replace this one
- `F12`: Go to definition
- `⌃-` / `⇧⌃-`: Go to previous / next location (e.g., `⌃-` to return to reference after jump to definition)
