## Comparing Branches

1. Click `Source Control` in the Activity Bar
2. In the bottom left panel, toggle `Search & Compare`
3. Click `Compare References...`, and choose the reference to compare to
    - Note that you usually want to choose `Working Tree` first, then select the branch to compare to. This will display the `Working Tree` on the right, and the other branch on the left
