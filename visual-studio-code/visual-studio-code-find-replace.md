# Visual Studio Code Find & Replace

- `⇧⌥F`: Find & replace in folder (when the Explorer has focus)
- `⇧⌘H`: Find & replace in all files
- `⌘↓`

## Find & Replace in Multiple Files

1. `⇧⌘H`: Find & replace in all files
2. `⌘⌥↩`: Replace all occurrences

## Find & Replace in Selection

1. Select the term to replace and "Find with Selection" (`⌘E`)
2. Make a selection to replace in
3. Open find and replace with `⌥⌘F`
4. Toggle on "Find in selection" with `⌥⌘L` (this isn't necessary if find and replace in selection automatically is on)
5. Replace all with `⌘↩`

Visual Studio Code has a "Auto Find in Selection" option, turning this on breaks this breaks using `⌘E` and `⌘G` to iterate through matches in a document, but there's a nice compromise: Just turning it on for multi-line selections.
