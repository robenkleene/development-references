# Terminal

- `⇧⌘T`: Show tab bar (with the tab bar visible, tabs can be dragged to merge them into one window, better to just make another tab to show the tab bar and then drag, just like in Safari)
- `⌘↑`: Go to previous prompt
- `⌘R`: Disable mouse reporting (useful to use default mouse behavior when using command-line applications that support the mouse)
- `^L`: Equivalent to clear

## Settings

- `Preferences > Profiles > Keyboard > Use Option as Meta Key`
