# Terminal

- `⇧⌘T`: Show tab bar (with the tab bar visible, tabs can be dragged to merge them into one window)
- `⌘↑`: Go to previous prompt
- `⌘R`: Disable mouse reporting (useful to use default mouse behavior when using command-line applications that support the mouse)
- `^L`: Equivalent to clear
