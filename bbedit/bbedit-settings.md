# BBEdit Settings

- Toggle off `Preferences > Application > Open documents into the front window when possible` because it's more flexible to use multiple windows
- Toggle off `Preferences > Editing > Display instances of selected text` because it's distracting when writing prose
- Toggle off `Preferences > Completion > Insert matching delimiters while typing` because otherwise it's hard to add Markdown code blocks with three backticks
- Set `Preferences > Completion > Show text completions: Only manually` because it's distracting when writing prose otherwise
- Toggle on `Preferences > Editor Defaults > Soft wrap text to: Page guide` because it's better for writing prose
- Toggle on `Keyboard > Option-↑ and option-↓ move by paragraphs`
