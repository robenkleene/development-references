# BBEdit Settings

- Toggle off `Preferences > Editing > Display instances of selected text` because it's distracting when writing prose
- Toggle off `Preferences > Completion > Insert matching delimiters while typing` because it makes it hard to add Markdown code blocks with three backticks
- Toggle on `Preferences > Editor Defaults > Soft wrap text to: Page guide` because it's better for writing prose
