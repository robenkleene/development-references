# Emacs vs. Vim Markdown Editing

## Vim

- Syntax highlighting breaks with checkboxes followed by links

## Emacs

- Emacs server allows editing the same file from multiple instances
- The return key works very well for checking checkboxes and following links
- `â‡¥` indents a list item, rather than inserting a tab character
