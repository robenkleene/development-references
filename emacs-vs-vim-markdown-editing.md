# Emacs vs. Vim Markdown Editing

## Vim

- Syntax highlighting breaks with checkboxes followed by links
- Saving is easier
- Consistency with using Vim for editing

## Emacs

- Emacs server allows editing the same file from multiple instances
- The return key works very well for checking checkboxes and following links
- `â‡¥` indents a list item, rather than inserting a tab character
- File management with Dired is more effective
- Easier to close a window when we're finished with it
- With Emacs we can avoid the oddities with Vim's system clipboard interactions
- Emacs uses the directory of the current file by default when performing shell operations (e.g., to use a script to make a link to a relative file).
