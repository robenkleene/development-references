# Basic Math

## Subtraction

`5 - 1 = 4`

- `5` is the minuend
- `1` is the subtrahend
- `4` is the difference

## Complement

We can also say `1` is the complement of `4` with respect to `5`, because it "completes" `4` to reach the whole amount of `5`.

### Two's Complement

In two's complement, it's called "complement" because `0000 0101` (binary for five) with the bits flipped and added one to get negative five `1111 1011`. When you add `0000 0101` and `1111 1011`, they sum to `0000 0000`, representing zero, completing the arithmetic within the 8-bit range. So `0000 0101` and `1111 1011` are the complements of each other.

### Geometry

The complementary angle of an angle is what is needed to make a total of $90^\circ$. So, if you have an angle of $30^\circ$, its complement is $60^\circ$ (since $30^\circ + 60^\circ = 90^\circ$).

### Set Theory

For a set $A$ within a universal set $U$, the complement of $A$ (denoted as $A'$ or $\overline{A}$) is the set of all elements in $U$ that are not in $A$. For example, if $U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ and $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$, then the complement of $A$ is $\{4, 5\}$.
