# iTerm vs. Terminal vs. Kitty vs. Alacritty

## Terminal

- Mouse reporting is more accurate
- Colors always require additional work
- Clicking the window once focuses, again moves the mouse cursor

## iTerm

- `‚å•`-click to disable mouse reporting while selecting text is more compatible with third-party keyboards than Terminal app which uses `fn` key.
- iTerm can be configured to not open a new terminal window when it activates.
- The hot key window.
- iTerm selection interferes with built-in selection in Vim, Emacs, and tmux
- Some of the customizations, like hiding the window title completely, are pretty cool
- Clicking the window once focuses, again moves the mouse cursor

## kitty

- kitty has a problem if Emacs is in a `tmux` pane and clicking between it and another pane triggers mouse selection.

## Alacritty

- Alacritty has no option to disable passing through the first mouse click (so clicking a window focuses it and sends the click event to the terminal). There are two key consequences of this: 1. We're always fixing the cursor position after clicking in the window to focus it, 2. It works differently than Emacs, which only focuses on first click, resulting in conflicting muscle memory between Emacs and the shell.

## Scrolling

- Of Ghostty, Alacritty, and iTerm2, iTerm2 is the only terminal where mouse wheel scrolling works properly in `tmux` (a single mouse wheel click starts copy mode or moves by `5` lines if already in copy mode)
