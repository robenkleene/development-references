# iTerm vs. Terminal

## Terminal

- Mouse reporting is more accurate
- Colors always require additional work
- Clicking the window once focuses, again moves the mouse cursor

## iTerm

- `‚å•`-click to disable mouse reporting while selecting text is more compatible with third-party keyboards than Terminal app which uses `fn` key.
- iTerm can be configured to not open a new terminal window when it activates.
- The hot key window.
- iTerm selection interferes with built-in selection in Vim, Emacs, and tmux
- Some of the customizations, like hiding the window title completely, are pretty cool
- Clicking the window once focuses, again moves the mouse cursor

## kitty

- kitty has a problem if Emacs is in a `tmux` pane and clicking between it and another pane triggers mouse selection.

## Alacritty

- Alacritty has no option to disable passing through the first mouse click (so clicking a window focuses it and sends the click event to the terminal)
