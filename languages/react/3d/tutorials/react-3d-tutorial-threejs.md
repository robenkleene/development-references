# `PerspectiveCamera`

`PerspectiveCamera( fov : Number, aspect : Number, near : Number, far : Number )`

- **FOV**: The extent of the scene that is visible in degrees.
- **Aspect**: Should almost always be the width divided by the height, to prevent distortion.
- **Near** and **Far**: Near and far clipping planes, objects further away than far, or closer than near, won't be rendered.
