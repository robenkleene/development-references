# 3D

- CUDA is a proprietary platform developed by Nvidia for for Nvidia cards, OpenCL is an open source, so it's used for AMD cards for example. Metal is Apple's equivalent to CUDA.
- OpenGL is just for graphics programming, OpenCL is general purpose.
- **Particle Advection**: Particles that have a particular force applied to them.
- **HDRI** ("High-Dynamic-Range Image"): Panoramic photograph that covers the entire field of vision and can be used to emit light into a CG scene. A regular photo stores much less data per pixel (32 bits vs. 8 bits). So to light a 3D scene, you want a larger range of brightness.

## Geometry

- **Normals**: Determine the inside and outside direction of faces, edges, or vertices.

## Noise

- Perlin noise was originally developed for procedural textures of objects.
- Perlin noise gives you smooth random numbers, random numbers that change smoothly over time.
## Shaders

### Vertex Shaders

Vertex shaders manipulate coordinates in 3D space and are called once per vertex.

A shape is made up of vertices, a vertex shader is given every vertex in turn, and it sets its final position as a 4D float vector (`gl_Position` in `OpenGL`).

### Fragment Shaders

Fragment shaders define RGBA colors for each pixel.
