# `lldb`

Note that `b` is *not* simply shorthand for `breakpoint`, these commands require `breakpoint`.

- `breakpoint set --file test.c --line 12` / `b test.c:12`
- `breakpoint list`
- `breakpoint delete 1`
- `breakpoint enable 1`
- `breakpoint disable 1`
- `breakpoint delete`: Delete all breakpoints
