# Tag Style Guide

- Use the singular, except when talking about a concept, e.g., `tools` for the idea of tools, vs. `tool` for a tool.
- For Bookmarks, don't double up the URL information, for example, it it is a link to "Reddit", don't add a `reddit` tag, "Reddit" will already appear in a search.
- Be broad instead of specific, `html` rather than `html5`.
- Use all lowercase (too many programs enforce this)

## Common Tags

- `buy-later`: For something I'd like to buy
- `watch-later`: For something to watch later
