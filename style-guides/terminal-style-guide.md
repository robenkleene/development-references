# Terminal Style Guide

**Non-Text**: **Selection**
**Comment**: `244` (`#808080`)
**Search Match**: `238` (`#444444`) / Cyan
**Search Current Match**: `240` (`#585858`) / Cyan
**Unselected Menu Item**: `240` (`#444444`) / **#A8A8A8**
**Selection** / **Selected Menu Item**: `238` (`#444444`) / White (only for selected menu item, don't change the foreground color for text selection)

## Notes

- One flaw of this is the contrast between non-text and comment isn't very much, but making the comments any brighter doesn't look good, and the non-text any darker becomes less legible.
