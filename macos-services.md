# macOS Services

- The `Services` menu can show four items before a second menu level is inserted
- Services can be used for the current Finder window by turning on the `View > Show Path Bar` option

## Troubleshooting

- Services don't work when the same keyboard shortcut is assigned for `Files and Folders` and `Text`.
- The `âŒ˜` key seems to be required for a shortcut to work.
