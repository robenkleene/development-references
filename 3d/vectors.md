# Vectors

- A vector has a magnitude and a direction in *n*-dimensional space
- A vector can be visualized as a *directed line segment* extending from a point called the *tail* to a point called the *head*
- A vector is in contrast to a regular *scalar*, which is an ordinary real-valued number having magnitude but no direction
- Vectors are typically written in bold, while scalars are written in italics
- A 3D vector can be represented by three numbers just like a scalar. The distinction between vectors and scalars is subtle, a vector is just an offset relative to a known point.
- A vector that's relative to the origin of the coordinate system is called a *position vector* or *radius vector*
- A triple of scalars can either be a point or a vector
- Points are absolute and vectors are relative
- Game programmers usually use the word vector to mean both points (position vectors), and algebraic directional vectors
- A vector is normal to a surface if it's perpendicular to the surface
