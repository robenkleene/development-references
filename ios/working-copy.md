# Working Copy

## Hard Reset

- In the branch history view, tap in individual commit and hit reset.

## Sync

When syncing folders between two iOS devices: After making a change on one device and pushing it, go to the other devices and revert changes then pull.

## When Syncing Shortcuts

For modified shortcuts, the export script will create new versions with a `2` appended to the filename. To prevent this, go in the Files app and delete all the modified shortcuts first, then re-export.
